   is a subsystem that supports collection and reporting of information about
   server activity.  Presently, the collector can count accesses to tables
   and indexes in both disk-block and individual-row terms.  It also tracks
   the total number of rows in each table, and information about vacuum and
   analyze actions for each table.  It can also count calls to user-defined
   functions and the total time spent in each one.
  </P

   command currently being executed by other server processes.  This
   facility is independent of the collector process.

>   Since collection of statistics adds some overhead to query execution,
   the system can be configured to collect or not collect information.
   This is controlled by configuration parameters that are normally set in
   <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>postgresql.conf</TT
>.  (See <A
HREF="runtime-config.html"
>Chapter 18</A
> for
   details about setting configuration parameters.)
  </P
><P
>   The parameter <A
HREF="runtime-config-statistics.html#GUC-TRACK-COUNTS"

   statistics are collected about table and index accesses.
  </P
><P
>   The parameter <A
HREF="runtime-config-statistics.html#GUC-TRACK-FUNCTIONS"

   usage of user-defined functions.
  </P
><P
>   The parameter <A
HREF="runtime-config-statistics.html#GUC-TRACK-ACTIVITIES"
>track_activities</A
> enables monitoring
   of the current command being executed by any server process.
  </P
><P
>   Normally these parameters are set in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>postgresql.conf</TT
> so
   that they apply to all server processes, but it is possible to turn
   them on or off in individual sessions using the <A
HREF="sql-set.html"
>SET</A
> command. (To prevent
   ordinary users from hiding their activity from the administrator,
   only superusers are allowed to change these parameters with
   <TT

>SET</TT
>.)
  </P
><P
>   The statistics collector transmits the collected
   information to backends (including autovacuum) through temporary files.
   These files are stored in the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pg_stat_tmp</TT

   When the postmaster shuts down, a permanent copy of the statistics
   data is stored in the <TT

NAME="MONITORING-STATS-VIEWS"
>27.2.2. Viewing Collected Statistics</A
></H2
><P
>   Several predefined views, listed in <A
HREF="monitoring-stats.html#MONITORING-STATS-VIEWS-TABLE"
>Table 27-1</A
>, are available to show the results
   of statistics collection.  Alternatively, one can
   build custom views using the underlying statistics functions.
  </P
><P
>   When using the statistics to monitor current activity, it is important
   to realize that the information does not update instantaneously.
   Each individual server process transmits new statistical counts to
   the collector just before going idle; so a query or transaction still in
   progress does not affect the displayed totals.  Also, the collector itself
   emits a new report at most once per <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>PGSTAT_STAT_INTERVAL</TT
>
   milliseconds (500 unless altered while building the server).  So the
   displayed information lags behind actual activity.  However, current-query
   information collected by <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>track_activities</TT
> is
   always up-to-date.
  </P
><P
>   Another important point is that when a server process is asked to display
   any of these statistics, it first fetches the most recent report emitted by
   the collector process and then continues to use this snapshot for all
   statistical views and functions until the end of its current transaction.
   So the statistics will show static information as long as you continue the
   current transaction.  Similarly, information about the current queries of
   all sessions is collected when any such information is first requested
   within a transaction, and the same information will be displayed throughout
   the transaction.
   This is a feature, not a bug, because it allows you to perform several
   queries on the statistics and correlate the results without worrying that
   the numbers are changing underneath you.  But if you want to see new
   results with each query, be sure to do the queries outside any transaction
   block.  Alternatively, you can invoke
   <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>pg_stat_clear_snapshot</CODE
>(), which will discard the
   current transaction's statistics snapshot (if any).  The next use of
   statistical information will cause a new snapshot to be fetched.
  </P
><P
>   A transaction can also see its own statistics (as yet untransmitted to the
   collector) in the views <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>pg_stat_xact_all_tables</TT

   <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>pg_stat_xact_sys_tables</TT

>pg_stat_xact_user_tables</TT
>, and
   <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"

   functions.  These numbers do not act as stated above; instead they update
   continuously throughout the transaction.
