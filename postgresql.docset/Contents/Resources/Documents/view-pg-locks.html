   whole relations (e.g., tables), individual pages of relations,
   individual tuples of relations,
   transaction IDs (both virtual and permanent IDs),
   and general database objects (identified by class OID and object OID,
   in the same way as in <TT

   <TT

><P
>   <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>granted</TT
> is true in a row representing a lock
   held by the indicated transaction.  False indicates that this transaction is
   currently waiting to acquire this lock, which implies that some other
   transaction is holding a conflicting lock mode on the same lockable object.
   The waiting transaction will sleep until the other lock is released (or a
   deadlock situation is detected). A single transaction can be waiting to
   acquire at most one lock at a time.
  </P
><P
>   Every transaction holds an exclusive lock on its virtual transaction ID for
   its entire duration.  If a permanent ID is assigned to the transaction
   (which normally happens only if the transaction changes the state of the
   database), it also holds an exclusive lock on its permanent transaction ID
   until it ends.  When one transaction finds it necessary to wait specifically
   for another transaction, it does so by attempting to acquire share lock on
   the other transaction ID (either virtual or permanent ID depending on the
   situation). That will succeed only when the other transaction
   terminates and releases its locks.
  </P
><P
>   Although tuples are a lockable type of object,
   information about row-level locks is stored on disk, not in memory,
   and therefore row-level locks normally do not appear in this view.
   If a transaction is waiting for a
   row-level lock, it will usually appear in the view as waiting for the
   permanent transaction ID of the current holder of that row lock.
  </P
><P
>   Advisory locks can be acquired on keys consisting of either a single
   <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>bigint</TT
> value or two integer values.  A <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>bigint</TT
> key is displayed with its
   high-order half in the <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>classid</TT
> column, its low-order half
   in the <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>objid</TT
> column, and <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>objsubid</TT
> equal
   to 1.  Integer keys are displayed with the first key in the
   <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>classid</TT
> column, the second key in the <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>objid</TT
>
   column, and <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>objsubid</TT
> equal to 2.  The actual meaning of
   the keys is up to the user.  Advisory locks are local to each database,
   so the <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>database</TT
> column is meaningful for an advisory lock.
  </P
><P
>   The <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>pg_locks</TT
> view displays data from both the
   regular lock manager and the predicate lock manager, which are
   separate systems.  When this view is accessed, the internal data
   structures of each lock manager are momentarily locked, and copies are
   made for the view to display.  Each lock manager will therefore
   produce a consistent set of results, but as we do not lock both lock
   managers simultaneously, it is possible for locks to be taken or
   released after we interrogate the regular lock manager and before we
   interrogate the predicate lock manager.  Each lock manager is only
   locked for the minimum possible time so as to reduce the performance
   impact of querying this view, but there could nevertheless be some
   impact on database performance if it is frequently accessed.
  </P
><P
>   <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>pg_locks</TT
> provides a global view of all locks
   in the database cluster, not only those relevant to the current database.
   Although its <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>relation</TT
> column can be joined
   against <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>pg_class</TT
>.<TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>oid</TT
> to identify locked
   relations, this will only work correctly for relations in the current
   database (those for which the <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>database</TT
> column
   is either the current database's OID or zero).
  </P
><P
>   The <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>pid</TT
> column can be joined to the
   <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>procpid</TT
> column of the
   <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>pg_stat_activity</TT
> view to get more
   information on the session holding or waiting to hold each lock.
   Also, if you are using prepared transactions, the
   <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>transaction</TT
> column can be joined to the
   <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>transaction</TT
> column of the
   <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>pg_prepared_xacts</TT
> view to get more
   information on prepared transactions that hold locks.
   (A prepared transaction can never be waiting for a lock,
   but it continues to hold the locks it acquired while running.)
